Variables
=========
There are a total of 68 variables with 180 values for each variable. The first two variables indicate the activity and the subject of the experiment. The remaining 66 variables (3 to 68) give the average of each variable for each of the 6 activities and each of the 30 subjects.

Var no.	 Name		Description						Units
1	 "Activity"	Activity performed by subject during experiment. 	One of the following: WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING

2	 "Subject"	Subject ID						From 1-30
3 to 68	 See list below	See description below					Normalized within [-1,1]


Description of Variables 3 to 68
================================
-The variables tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. They are prefixed with 't' to denote time domain signals.
-The variables tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ are derived by separating the acceleration signal into body and gravity acceleration signals.
-The jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ) were obtained by deriving the body linear acceleration and angular velocity in time. 
-The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
-A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
-mean or std refers to the mean value and standard deviation respectively for each set of experiment.
-'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Summary choices
===============
In the original data set for each observation of mean and standard deviation, the arithmetic mean was used. In the code used to generate the average measurement of each variable for each of the 6 activities and each of the 30 subjects, the arithmetic mean was also used.


Experiment study design
==================================================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
